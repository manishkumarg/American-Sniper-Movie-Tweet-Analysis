# American-Sniper-Movie-Tweet-Analysis
The Problem

As you may know the movie was directed by Clint Eastwood , starring Bradley Cooper and was based on the life story of Chris Kyle .

Your first task is to break the twitter hashtags into proper words, for example:
#goldenglobes -> golden globes,
#siennamiller -> sienna miller ...Example 1

Your second task is to find out what people have said about these three personalities ( Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper and Chris Kyle ), in other words find out the top trending topics about these people in the current dataset.
For example, consider these 3 tweets about Sienna Miller from the same dataset:
● Sienna Miller is stunning!!! #GoldenGlobes She brought the heat in @AmericanSniper!!!
● @AmericanSniper and @FoxcatcherUK actress #SiennaMiller looks stunning in #Forevermark diamond jewelry. http://t.co/2Y8JvJ8KlF
● Watching #AmericanSniper awesome acting by @BradleyCooperUS and @SiennaMillerr playing the life of Chris Kyle and Taya a ten
So for Sienna Miller one trending topic can be “looks stunning” or just “stunning” and another can be “awesome acting”, this can be represented as follows:
Sienna Miller
